            <h3>Worship Music</h3>
            <p>Worship music is praise. The majority of biblical songs contain elements of praise, if it is not their primary theme. Praise-songs include several genres: psalms, canticles, hymns, and doxologies. The psalms were sung in the OT in the synagogue and the early church kept this practice. But the Word of God also commands the church to sing “new songs” (Ps. 149:1).</p>

                Another praise song about grace is "This is Amazing Grace" by Phil Wickham. While the premise is similar to the earlier piece, this one is more lively and can get the congregation jumping. The song talks about how powerful God is, reminds us of everything He's done, and encourages all to respond in praise.
